# minor_project

## Description 
This project classifies images according to the test model.
I have created the model to classify between 'motorbikes', 'flowers', 'ice cream cone'.

### How to used?
The user have to run the code and give the url of the image in jpg(from any search engine). 
The model will give the output accordingly.
